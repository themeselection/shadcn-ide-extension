## What is the Shadcn Studio IDE extension?

This extension connects the Shadcn Studio toolbar to agents included in many popular IDEs and extensions.

When you start the Shadcn Studio CLI, the toolbar will search for other agents running locally.

This way, you can use the Shadcn Studio toolbar to select elements and provide context to your AI agent without switching between your IDE and browser.

Apart from this, you can also access the Shadcn Studio Blocks & themes from the toolbar to use them directly in your project.
